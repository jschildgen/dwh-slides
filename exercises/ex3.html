            <p><b>You will need the answers and queries from this exercise sheet for the next submission (Challenge 3). Write down your commands and save your solutions (e.g., a photo of your ME/R model as an image file). It is recommended to work on the OTH Exasol database (see Exercise Sheet 1).</b></p>

    <h1>Exercise 1: Data Modelling</h1>
    <p>In this exercise, you will plan a data warehouse schema for your project.<br>
        In a later exercise, you will load data from different sources into that schema.</p>
        
    <ol>
        <li>Draw an ME/R Model for your scenario. What is the fact relationship? Which dimensions are hierarchical? Use a pen and a paper, or draw on a tablet, or use a drawing tool. You do not need put all attributes in the diagram, only the most important ones.</li>
        <li>For each measure, which data type, range, and aggregation type (FLOW, STOCK, VPU) do they have?</li>
        <li>Map your model to a relational star schema by writing <code>CREATE TABLE</code> commands to create a star schema in your database. Which ones are the dimension tables, which one is the fact table? Do not create a dimension table for the date dimension. Simply store dates/timestamps as <code>DATE</code> or <code>TIMESTAMP</code> values directly in the fact table. Please use identical column names for foreign-keys (e.g. sales(market_id) and markets(market_id)). Also here: Is it really necessary to have all attributes of your sources? Think of which descriptive attributes in dimension tables and which measures you need and which of them you can throw away.</li>
        <li>Insert two example rows in each of your tables.</li>
        <li>How would a snowflake schema look for your scenario?</li>
        <li>Discuss pros and cons of the star and snowflake schema and decide which one you will use for your project. You can also use a combination of both.</li>
    </ol>
