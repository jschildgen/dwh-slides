    <h1>Exercise 1: Data Modelling</h1>
    <p>When you solve this exercise on your local database, create a new schema for this exercise: <code>CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS ex5;</code> If you use the OTH database, use your <code>FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME</code> user and schema.</p>
    <p>In this exercise, we are planning a data warehouse schema for a bike-rental company.<br>
        They will load customer data from a relational database. Each customer has a cust_id, name, email, phone, street, area, city, plan, price.<br>
        Furthermore, bikes are imported from Excel files which are provided by the different bike manufacturers. Each bike has bike_id, bike_type, model, brand.<br>
        The company has different bike stations which have a station_id, street, area, city<br>
        The bike-rental events can be loaded via an API. This API provides the information which customers drove which bike when from which station to which station. It shows the timestamp of issue, the rental duration, the rental price, and the number of bikes that parked at the return station after the rental.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Draw an ME/R Model for this scenario. Which dimensions are hierarchical?</li>
        <li>For each measure, which data type, range, and aggregation type do they have?</li>
        <li>Map your model to a relational star schema by writing <code>CREATE TABLE</code> commands to create a star schema in your database. Which ones are the dimension tables, which one is the fact table?</li>
        <li>Insert two example rows in each of your tables.</li>
        <li>Transform your star schema (including the data) into a snowflake schema with <code>CREATE TABLE</code> and <code>INSERT INTO ... SELECT</code> commands. Use a prefix <code>sf_</code> for the new tables (e.g., <code>sf_markets</code>). You can use the <code>IDENTITY</code> option to automatically generate unique primary-key values: <code>my_id INT INDENTITY</code></li>
    </ol>
