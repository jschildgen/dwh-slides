Make sure that VPN to the OTH is on and that your Exasol VM has internet access. You can configure NAT in the VM settings under Network, and add a port forwarding from host port 8563 to guest port 8563. Then connect your DBeaver to localhost.<br>
        <pre>create or replace connection jdbc_con to 'jdbc:exa:10.127.0.33/3CB... (see below)' 
user 'FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME' identified by 'Your OTH Exasol DB Password';

EXPORT myschema.mytable INTO JDBC AT jdbc_con TABLE FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.mytable;</pre></li>
