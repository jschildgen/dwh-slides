    <h1>Exercise 1: Exasol System Tables</h1>
    <p>Take a look at the system tables in the schemas <code>SYS</code> and <code>EXA_STATISTICS</code>. These queries are more interesting on the OTH database server than on your local system. Write SQL queries to answer the following questions:</p>
    <p>Remark: You can make the system tables (actually, they are views) in the schemas <code>SYS</code> and <code>EXA_STATISTICS</code> visible in DBeaver's schema explorer by editing your Exasol connection: General/Allgemein, Navigation View: Customize, Show System Objects.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Find out when your user was created.</li>
        <li>What's the total raw-object size (uncompressed) and mem-object size (compressed) of all tables where you have access.</li>
        <li>For each table on which you have access, list the table name, the raw-object size, mem-object size and compute the compression ratio (the higher the better).</li>
        <li>For each weekday (Monday, Tuesday, ...), compute the average idle time of the database.</li>
        <li>List the 5 top hours within a week (e.g., on Tuesdays 15:00 - 16:00) when most users are connected to the database.</li>
        <li>Find out when the hard disk was accessed most.</li>
        <li>What was the average duration of all successful <code>SELECT</code> queries within the last 14 days?</li>
    </ol>
