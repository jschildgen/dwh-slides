    <h1>Exercise 1A: Exasol (Local installation)</h1>
    <p>We will use the Exasol database in almost all exercise sheets. In this exercise sheet, you set up and connect to an Exasol database (or use the OTH Exasol DB, see Exercise 1B).</p>
    <p>Exasol cannot simply be installed on Windows/Linux/MacOS. You have to install VirtualBox, VMWare or another VM player (or use Docker) and import the OVA image that you can download from the <a href="https://www.exasol.com" target="_blank">Exasol website</a> (do not install Exasol via the ISO file!). You need a lot of free disk space and more than 4 GB RAM. If you do not want to install Exasol on your machine, work on exercise 1B instead.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Download the Exasol database image (OVA file) and import it into VirtualBox. Then start the VM.</li>
        <li>If you do not have the SQL client <a href="https://www.dbeaver.io" target="_blank">DBeaver</a> on your PC, install it.</li>
        <li>Set up a connection to your Exasol database (connection details are shown in the VM).</li>
        <li>Download and unzip the retail_mini.zip from ELO. Open retail_mini.sql in DBeaver and take a look at the create table commands to inform yourself what the dataset is about.</li>
        <li>Edit the file paths on all <code>IMPORT</code> commands. Then execute all commands - but not all together, one statement after the other to better see whether it worked! If you use the OTH database, the tables and the data are already there.</li>
        
        

    </ol>

    <h1>Exercise 1B: Exasol (OTH Database)</h1>
    <p>When working on CIP pool computers, please use the OTH database. When working from home, you a VPN connection to the OTH network is required.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If you do not have the SQL client <a href="https://www.dbeaver.io" target="_blank">DBeaver</a> on your PC, install it.</li>
        <li>Set up a connection to the OTH Exasol database. The connection string is <code>194.95.108.54</code>, user and password: <code>STUDENT</code> </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Exercise 2: Working with Duplicates, Strings, Dates, and Timestamps</h1>
    <p>Write SQL queries on the tables in the RETAIL schema.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Explore the RETAIL schema, its tables and the data: <code>OPEN SCHEMA retail; SELECT * FROM SYS.CAT; SELECT * FROM markets LIMIT 50; ...</code></li>
        <!--<li>Write an SQL query to list every state (<code>AREA</code> column) together with the number of markets in that area and the average <code>POPULATION</code> of the cities in that area.</li>-->
        <li>Write an SQL query to find for every day in August 2014 the total revenue (<code>SUM(price)</code>) of all sales in markets in Hannover.</li>
        <!--
            select s.sales_date, sum(price)
from retail.markets m join retail.sales s on m.market_id = s.market_id
and m.city = 'Hannover'
and s.sales_date between '2014-08-01' and '2014-08-31'
group by 1 order by 1;
        -->
        <li>In DBeaver, write <code>SELECT CURRENT_</code> and the auto-completion feature shows to you some variables. Guess what they deliver and try them out. Not all of the suggested variables are valid in Exasol.</li>
        <li>Does the EAN column in the article table contain unique values? If not, return the duplicate EAN values.</li>
        <li>Based on 4., find the articles that have a non-unique EAN value.</li>
        <li>Exasol supports the clause <code>WITH INVALID ...</code>. Find out how to use this feature and solve problem 4 and 5 again.</li>
        <li>For each product group, generate a list (separated by a comma and a space) of articles in that product group that cost less than 0.50 EUR.<br>
        <table><tr><th>PRODUCT_GROUP_DESC</th><th>ARTICLES</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Frozen Foods</td><td>Baguettebr√∂tchen, Brinkchen Semmel, ...</td></tr></table><br></li>
        <li>The same query as 4., but this time include the prices in the list of artices in parentheses, and order the list from low to high prices.
            <table><tr><th>PRODUCT_GROUP_DESC</th><th>ARTICLES</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Frozen Foods</td><td>Lang.Multi 5 Squeezy Milcheis (0 EUR), ...</td></tr></table><br>
        </li>
        <li>Print the current date in the following format: 12. January 2023</li>
        <li>For each article in the product group Pharmacy, return the article_id, the description and the timestamp of its last sale.</li>
        <li>For every hour of the day 2014-10-01, how many sales were there within that hour?
            <table><tr><th>HOUR_OF_DAY</th><th>NUM_SALES</th></tr>
                <tr><td>2014-10-01-00.00.00.000000</td><td>6</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2014-10-01-01.00.00.000000</td><td>7</td></tr></table><br>
            	
        </li>
        <li>Take a look in the system table <code>EXA_SQL_LAST_DAY</code>. It shows statistics about all SQL queries that were sent to the database within the last 24 hours. How many SELECT queries were executed within the last 30 minutes? Execute the command <code>FLUSH STATISTICS;</code> before, to refresh the statistical system tables.</li>
        <li>Calculate your age in days.</li>
