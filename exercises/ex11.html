    <h1>Exercise 1: Window Functions</h1>
    <p>Write the queries for this exercise on the vaccinations table from the previous exercise sheet:<br>
        <code>vaccinations(v_date, country, continent, cases, vaccinations, population)</code></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Show all vaccinations in Germany in January 2022. Calculate a rank for each row. The day with the highest number of vaccinations in Germany should get the rank 1.</li>
        <li>Show all vaccinations in Europe in January 2022. Again, calculate a rank. Now, rank 1 means that this was the day with the highest number of vaccinations in that country.</li>
        <li>Show all vaccinations in Germany. Display an additional column total_vaccinations that shows the total number of vaccinations until that day.</li>
        <li>For each country in Europe, show the total number of vaccinations and the ratio of that value to the overall number of vaccinations in Europe (e.g. Germany 17%, UK 14%, France 13%, ...). Write the query once without using the function RATIO_TO_REPORT and once with it.</li>
        <li>Show all vaccinations in Germany. Display an additional column "7_days_incidence". This is the number of new cases within 7 days per 100,000 inhabitants.</li>
        <li>For each country in Europe, calculate the 7-days incidence on the 1st May 2022.</li>
    </ol>
