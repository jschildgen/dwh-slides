# Challenge 3: Data Modelling and Importing the Data

**Tasks:** 
1. Fill out this workbook. You can use a markdown software (e.g., [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/)) for that, or an online editor (e.g., [md2pdf](https://md2pdf.netlify.app/) or Notion). 
2. You can use a [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://padomi.id.lv/PRG/par__/Markdown-Cheat-Sheet.pdf) to understand how to write *italic*, **bold**, `code`, etc.
3. Fill out this workbook with care. It will be graded with points. Write high-class content, but compact. Before you submit, read everything again and improve. 
4. When you are finished, export your workbook as a PDF and upload it to ELO before the deadline. Open your PDF in a PDF viewer to check whether everything was exported correctly and no code blocks are cut off.
5. In this workbook, you need to write SQL commands. Put them in code blocks and be careful that long queries are not cut off at the right border of the page.

```sql
-- This is just an example. You do not need to write anything here.
```

*You can fill out this workbook in English or German. You need to write everywhere where you see this:* 🖊️


## Title

*Please, again write your project title (as in the first workbook) here). If you want to change your title, write here the old and the new title.*

## Staging Area: Tables
*Write down your `CREATE TABLE` commands to create your tables in which you import your data from the data sources.  (Ex. Sheet 4, Exercise 1.3)*

🖊️

## Forms of Heterogeneity
*Which forms of heterogeneity exist between two of your data sources? Give at least three short examples. (Ex. Sheet 4, Exercise 1.4)*

* 🖊️

## Star / Snowflake Schema
*Your task was to decide whether to use a star schema or a snowflake schema (or a mix of both) within your data warehouse. Provide the `CREATE TABLE` commands of your final schema here. (Ex. Sheet 4, Exercise 1.6)*

**Fact table(s):**

🖊️ 

**Dimension table(s):**

🖊️


## IMPORT
*Write down IMPORT commands to import data from your data sources into your staging area tables. (Ex. Sheet 4, Exercise 2.1)*

🖊️


## Numbers
* Numbers of rows in your biggest table: 🖊️
* Size (KB, MB, or GB) of your biggest table: 🖊️
* Name of that biggest table: 🖊️
* Total size (KB, MB, or GB) of your schema: 🖊️


## ME/R Model
*If you use Zettlr, Notion, or another local Markdown editor, embed the image of your ME/R Model here by writing `![ME/R Model](mer.jpg)`. If you create your PDF with a markdown-to-PDF conversion tool, then create this workbook PDF (without the image), and the image PDF as two separate files and combine them into one single PDF (e.g., with PDFSAM or pdftk). (Ex. Sheet 3, Exercise 1.1)*
